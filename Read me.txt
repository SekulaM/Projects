IF THE APP CRUSHES ON START, CLOSE THE RUNNING APP IN THE TASK MANAGER!!

This is a simulation of the UEFA Champions League tournament, which starts at the group stage.

How the app works
1. teams are put into the 4 pots (according to their strength)
2. teams are drawned into 8 groups (each group has 4 teams, one from each pot - two teams from the same country cannot be
in the same group, if this happens the draw automatically restarts)
3. after the draw, teams will play each other in the group stage (twice, so there are 6 rounds in total)
4. after the 6 rounds, the two best teams from each group will advance to the knockout stage (8 final , the winner of the
group will face a random team which ended up at the second place in a group)
5. after 8 final, the winners advance to the quarterfinal, winners of quarterfinal to semifinal and winners of semifinal
to the final
